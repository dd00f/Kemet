	- Recruit on top of an existing army doesn't trigger attack start powers, night/day



- State goes negative based on player - change to individual state fields

- Battle : current player should always be in the same place ( flag to switch between attack & defense )

- enable DI card reinforcements at the end of turns

- Player fillCannonical uses negative values for used battle cards
		for (BattleCard card : usedBattleCards) {
			canonicalForm.set(getCardStatusIndex(canonicalPlayerIndex, card), (byte) -1);
		}

- Disable canonical form locking + checks on set for speeeeed

- Funny questions for game designers
	
	- Does BLUE_1_RECRUITING_SCRIBE influence the ENLISTMENT DI card to give extra free recruits ?
		Assumption : yes, because it triggers a special recruit action.
			
	- Does BLUE 1 RECRUITING SCRIBE influence the Reinforcements DI card to give extra free recruits at the end of a battle ?
		Assumption : no, it's a day power

	- Does BLUE 1 RECRUITING SCRIBE influence the Blue 4 power Reinforcements to give extra free recruits ?
		Assumption : no, it's a day power
	
	- Does TELEPORT reduce the cost of the Teleport DI card by 1 ?
		Assumption : no, because it's the DI card that costs 1, not the teleportation itself.
	
	- Does Priest of Ra (reduce all cost by 1) prevent the -1 mana from the DI card : Mana Theft
		Assumption : no, because the mana is stolen, not spent. 
	
	- When using Blue 4 power Reinforcements, can it trigger a battle during night phase in your city by recruiting on top of an enemy army ?
		Assumption : yes
		
	- When using Blue 4 power Reinforcements triggers a battle at night : Do "day" powers activate for this battle ( Initiative, Deadly Trap, dedication to battle )
		Assumption : no, they only work during the day phase.
	
	- When using Blue 4 power Reinforcements in combination with the Legion power( max 7 army size ). Can the new recruits be put on an army to reach a size 6 or 7, considering that Legion is a day power
		Assumption : yes ( it just feels odd otherwise )
	
	- If an army with devourer moves on tile with enemy army with Deep Desert Snake & Deadly Trap, does the attacker take deadly trap damage ?
		- Devourer negates damage outside of combat.
		- Deep Desert snake negates enemy beast.
		Assumption : no
		
	- If an army with Deep Desert Snake & Initiative moves on tile with enemy army with Devourer, does the defender take Initiative damage ?

		- Deep Desert snake negates enemy beast.
		Assumption : no
		
	- If a DI card gets vetoed, does the player who played it still have to pay the mana cost for DI card that won't get activated ?
		Assumption : yes, DI card is first played & paid for, then the veto is applied.
		
	- If army with devourer moves on tile with enemy army with Deep Desert Snake, the attacker then wins the battle & does 2 damage to the enemy 
		army, forcing them to retreat or recall. does the attacker get an extra VP for the battle victory from the Devourer ?
		- Devourer gets an extra VP on battle win with 2 damage
		- Deep Desert snake negates enemy beast.
		- However, Deep Desert Snake is gone after the battle
		Assumption : no, because the whole battle is done as if the Devourer wasn't there.

	- If an army gets 1 damage because of the "deadly trap" power, can the player use the DI card ENLISTMENT be used just before the battle
		begins to fill his army back ?
		Assumption : No, because the game state switches to "battle" & reinforcements is a day DI card.
		
	- When using the DI card escape, can the escaping army use teleport 
		either from one of its city district, or the teleport DI card, or the teleport ability from an obelisk ?
		assumption : no

		assumption : yes, otherwise they could keep on moving to attack. 

	- Khnum's Sphinx : Is there a 2 power cost to recruit on top of an enemy army with Khnum's sphinx in your city.
		Assumption : no : icon & text implies a 2 power cost on Move action. Not on Recruit action. 
	
	- Is it legal to move an army and leave the beast behind, alone, with no units, therefore forcing an automatic recall of the beast ?
		Assumption : yes
	
	- When an army moves and leaves a beast behind, do the beast bonus movement still apply to the army that keeps moving ?
		Assumption : yes, army movement capacity is fixed from the beginning of the move action, regardless of how it evolves.

	- When an army moves and joins another army with a beast that gives a movement bonus, does the army movement capacity increase during the current action  ?
		Assumption : no, army movement capacity is fixed from the beginning of the move action, regardless of how it evolves.
	
	- When an army moves and leaves a Phoenix behind just before crossing city walls, does that army still get to bypass city walls ?

	- When an army moves and leaves a Phoenix behind one tile before reaching the opponent city front, does that army still get to bypass city walls ?
		Assumption : no, the army must have the Phoenix with it to cross walls.
	
	- When army with Phoenix is about to do a second move to a enemy walled city tile which has an army with Deep Desert Snake, 
		does the phoenix power still allow it to bypass city walls since Deep Desert Snake cancels the Phoenix?
		Assumption : yes, the move happens before Deep Desert Snake disables the creature.

	- For the following DI Cards that give bonus when battle is won:
		 Glory + 4 prayer points if battle is won
		 Reinforcements : 3 free recruit if battle is won
		 Divine Protection : no damage is battle is won
		 If the player who played those DI card gets wins the battle, but his entire army killed due to damage inflicted by his 
		 opponent and/or his battle card, do those DI card still get activated ?
		 Assumption : yes, they are applied after battle winner resolution, but before battle damage. It's the only execution order that 
		 makes sense for "Divine Protection"
	
	- Is the following move legal ?
		Starting with an army with 5 troops that can move by 3 tiles & breach walls, located in front of a opponent city. 
		The opponent has no troops in all its city districts.

		Can the army do the following moves : 
		1 - Move to the first opponent district with the whole army.
		2 - Move to the second opponent district with 4 troops, leaving 1 troop behind.
		3 - Move to the third opponent district with 3 troops, leaving 1 troop behind.
		Impact : this move transfers 3 pyramid victory points from one player to another in a single action.
